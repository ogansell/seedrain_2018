Title: Abstractions for Promise-Based Asynchronous Programming
Version: 1.0.1

Description: Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous
    programming in R using promises. Asynchronous programming is useful
    for allowing a single R process to orchestrate multiple tasks in
    the background while also attending to something else. Semantics
    are similar to 'JavaScript' promises, but with a syntax that is
    idiomatic R.
